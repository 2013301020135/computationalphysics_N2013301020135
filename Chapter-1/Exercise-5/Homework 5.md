# **The Fifth Homework**



## *Abstract*
	The problem chosen is 1.2, the displacement of a horizontally uniform moving object. 
    We use Python to design the programs, which can realize the purpose of this assignment. 
    Besides, this program is a general one which not only can solve this specific problem, 
    but also can handle this sort of problem with different initial displacement, velocity, and time.
    This article deals with the ideas for these problems, the programs ,and the results.

## *Introduction*
 - Numerical method has been widely used as an approximation of the exact solution of an ordinary equation. To determine how well this approximation is, it is of great significance for us to determine errors of Euler Methods-how far the Euler solution found deviate from the exact solution. 
 - In this assignments, two factors-step length and the equation itself-have been discussed to show how they influence the deviation. Also, a way to approximately estimate the errors is included and illustrated using Problem 2 of chapter 1.

## *Body*
### 1. Requirement
 - Calculate `x` as a function of `t`;
 - Compare the results with the exact solution to `dx/dt=v`.


### 2. Ideas
 


### 3. Programs
 - [Ex05.py](https://github.com/2013301020135/computationalphysics_N2013301020135/blob/master/Chapter-1/Exercise-5/Ex05.py)


### 4. Results
 - Time step `dt=0.5s`:
